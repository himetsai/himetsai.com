This is Ray Tsai's personal website [himetsai.com](https://himetsai.com)

## Getting Started

Before you do anything, run:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Run the production server:

```bash
npm run build
#then
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To deploy the website to vercel, simply push the code to the repository.

## Finally

If you like me as a person, **please give me a star**.

Thank you very much.
